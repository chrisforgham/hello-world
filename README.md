# hello-world
This is my first respository
I'm a product manager that really enjoys learning new things, even though I'm not fluent in writing code these days I had some expereince in my past with really old languages like Miranda and Prolog, so that dates me.  Being able to be the glue between the engineering teams, business teams, and the customer is where I am able to provide value by getting the right features done at the right time for the business and it's customers. I believe it's best to start small with minumum marketable features and learn and grow from there for new software projects.  For stable more mature features, it's best to really listen to customers and build the feature sets to take the product further to provide greater value and increase satisfaction
Outside of work my wife is my best friend and partner through everything, and I'm addicted to snowboarding as much as possible before I can't anymore. I have a few other hobbies, but snowboarding has driven my life since I was 13 years old, and it's still one of my driving forces in life to always be improving and concur any mountain, with hard work and time anything is possible.
